# face_mask_detection
A model which has been trained with Keras/Tensorflow. Firstly, it detect faces in real time and determine "mask" or "no mask".

Objective:
In our proposed system, we will use a live video stream and finally in the output it will display the text written mask or no_mask when someone wearing or not wearing mask respectively. Our goal is to identify whether the person on the image/video stream is wearing a face mask or not with the help of computer vision and deep learning.
